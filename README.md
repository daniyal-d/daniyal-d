## Hi there, I'm Daniyal Dawood ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a doubleâ€‘major in **Computer Science** and **Philosophy** at **UTâ€¯Austin**, interested in the intersection of technology and ethics.
I enjoy building projectsthat solve real-world problems and discussing the impact technology has on society.
Feel free to reach out to discuss anything!
