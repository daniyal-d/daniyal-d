## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Daniyal Dawood

Iâ€™m a doubleâ€‘major in **Computer Science** and **Philosophy** at **UTâ€¯Austin**, interested in the intersection of technology and ethics.  
I enjoy building projects that solve real-world problems and discussing the impact technology has on society.  
Feel free to reach out if youâ€™d like to chat about tech, philosophy, or anything in between!
